# Minting an NFT

### How to Mint:

#### **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**

Start by [connecting your wallet to the IRONBALL platform](getting-started.md). Ensure you have sufficient ETH available to cover the minting price and any associated gas fees.

#### **Step 2: Choose a Collection**

Explore the NFT collections available on IRONBALL. Each collection has its unique purpose, minting price, and lock duration. Confirm that your chosen collection is actively minting by checking its status.

#### **Step 3: Mint Your NFTs**

Select the number of NFTs you want to mint. Click the "Mint" button, and the required ETH will be locked in a smart contract for the duration set by the creator. This locked amount secures your eligibility for a refund after the lock period, as per the collection's terms.
